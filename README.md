# RitualVessels

##  Tracks a score of how valuable Rituals are to use a [Blood-filled Vessel](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Blood-filled_Vessel) on.

### Why?
1. Enter toxic sewers with full stacked exile setup & capture some gigantism exiles + others in blood-filled vessels
2. Use 2 blood-filled vessels on a T17 map alongside all of your loot multipliers
3. When you do rituals in the T17, they will drop excessively large amounts of loot

### Values
Gigantism Exile = 5
Exile = 1
Unique = 1
